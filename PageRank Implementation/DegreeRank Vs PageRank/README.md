DegreeRank versus PageRank
==========================
The program tests whether there is a correlation between PageRank and DegreeRank of a node i.e., if a node has high indegree then will it have higher pagerank ?

The dataset used is that of [High-energy physics theory citation network](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-HepTh.html).
