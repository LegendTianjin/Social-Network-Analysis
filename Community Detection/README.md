Community Detection
===================
A network is said to have [communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_structure) in its structure, if a set of nodes can be grouped togther such that the nodes have a high number of connections amongst each other, and only a few connections with the remaining nodes of the network.
Finding communities in a network is useful in numerous situations, and can result in valuable insights in the network.  
But, detecting communities in a network has always been a challenging task. Several methods have been proposed attempting to detect communities.  
The directory contains programs for community detection in a network using the following two approaches :
* Using brute-force method.
* Implementing Girvan-Newman algorithm.
