Random Walks
=============
This program generates [random graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_graph) of different sizes, and determines for each graph, the no. of [random walks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) required such that each node is visited at least once, i.e. to visit the graph completely.

For a graph of a particular size, the number of random walks required for our purpose usually vary with different instances of the experiment.
For example, when we calculate no. of random walks in two separate experiments for the same graph, the values may differ.
So, we calculate the _average no. of random walks required_ (averaged over a number of instances).

Finally, a plot is drawn telling how the no. of required random walks vary with the size of the graph.
