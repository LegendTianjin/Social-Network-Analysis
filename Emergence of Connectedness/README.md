Emergence of Connectedness
==========================
Given a graph with ___n___ number of nodes and no edges, what is the least number of edges (formed choosing any two nodes at random) 
required to make the graph connected ?

This program determines the answer to the above question.

A plot is drawn for _Size of the graph_ Vs. _No. of edges required to make the graph [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory))_.
