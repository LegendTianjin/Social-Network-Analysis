Effect of Communities on Cascades
=================================
## What is a Cascade ?
Whenever an idea or information diffuses on a network, then the trajectory of the diffusion can be termed as cascade.

## Effect(s) of communities on information cascade in networks
Whenever something (an idea or behavior) is spreading on the network having communities, then the question arises that whether the communities in the network will have an effect on how the idea spreads in the network.  
The answer is __Yes__.  
__"Higher is the density of a community in the network, the more difficult it is to inject the new idea/innovation into this community".__

Suppose a network consists of two communities (connected by a weak tie) as shown below :  
!["Network having two communities"](https://github.com/Shubhamdubey2111/Network-Science/blob/master/Cascading%20Behavior%20in%20Networks/Effect%20of%20Communities%20on%20Cascades/Communities.png "Network having two communities")

Now, if a new idea or behavior is introduced into one community then it does not get easily passed to another community in the network, in other words __"Ideas get trapped inside communities"__.
