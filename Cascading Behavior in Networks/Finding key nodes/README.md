Diffusion in a Network using Key Nodes as Initial Adopters
==========================================================
When any new product/idea/innovation diffuses in a social network, the actual problem is with getting started. Since it's risky for an individual to adopt this new idea, hence the diffusion of the product encounters resistance from people in the network.

There is only the starting struggle for any product/innovation to come in the market.

One way of overcoming the starting struggle is to increase the payoff associated with the product usage. As payoff increases, people will be more likely to adopt it.  
But, increasing the payoff is not always a viable option.

Another very nice approach is to use the key people in the network.  
So, instead of trying to advertise the product to every single person in the network, we carefully choose a few key people, and infect them with the new product. Then rest of the diffusion is easy, people follow each other and start adopting the product. This way the product spreads in the entire network.  
This is the same technique used in [Viral Marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_marketing).  
__For Example__, when a new product, say a smartphone is launched in the market, then celebrities endorse and advertise the product. The people following those celebrities start considering the product risk-free and hence adopt the product. Slowly, the product sweeps the entire market.

The program illustrates that the cascade is more likely to complete on the network when the key nodes are chosen as the initial adopters.  
On choosing a particular set of nodes as the initial adopter of a new behavior, if the cascade completes quickly, then it is very likely that these nodes are key nodes of the network.  
Hence, this technique can be used to find key nodes of the network.
